Network Modeling
=====

# About

This repository was written as a companion for a presentation I gave at Duke's Social Networks and Health Workshop on 5/16/19 titled "Diffusion & ERGM" ([available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZHhRYokugU) and distributed to all attendees). The workshop gives an introduction to models that deal with network simulation, autocorrelation, and diffusion. Although this repository was built by me, much of the code is adapted from tutorials by James Moody, Jeff Smith, Jake Fisher, the statnet team, Tom Valente, and George G. Vega Yon.


# Usage
Users are advised to run all scripts within the "Code" directory in the order of their numerical prefixes.
